# Hello, World ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Opsimate blog! This is a short example post to show how content is structured and rendered.

## What youâ€™ll see

- Front matter for metadata (title, date, tags, author)
- Regular Markdown headings, lists, and links
- Code blocks that render with safe HTML

## Example code

```ts
type Greeting = {
  who: string;
  when: Date;
};

export function greet({ who, when }: Greeting) {
  return `Hello, ${who}! Posted on ${when.toDateString()}`;
}
```
